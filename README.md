## Analytical Questions and SQL Queries

### 1. Total Sales Revenue
Problem: Calculate the total revenue generated from all coffee sales. This query helps understand the overall financial performance.
```sql
SELECT
    SUM(CAST(REPLACE(money, 'R', '') AS DECIMAL(10, 2))) AS TotalRevenue
FROM
    coffee_sales;
```
### Explanation:
REPLACE(money, 'R', ''): This function removes the 'R' prefix from the money column, converting 'R38.70' to '38.70'.

CAST(... AS DECIMAL(10, 2)): This converts the cleaned string value to a decimal number with 10 total digits and 2 decimal places, suitable for accurate monetary calculations.

SUM(...): This aggregates all the converted money values to provide the total sales revenue.

---

### 2. Top 5 Best-Selling Coffee Products
Problem: Identify the top 5 coffee products based on the number of units sold. This helps in understanding product popularity and inventory management.
```sql
SELECT TOP 5
    coffee_name,
    COUNT(*) AS NumberOfSales
FROM
    coffee_sales
GROUP BY
    coffee_name
ORDER BY
    NumberOfSales DESC;
```
### Explanation:
COUNT(*): Counts the occurrences of each coffee_name to determine sales volume.

GROUP BY coffee_name: Groups the rows by coffee_name so that COUNT(*) calculates the sales for each unique coffee product.

ORDER BY NumberOfSales DESC: Sorts the results in descending order based on the NumberOfSales to bring the best-selling products to the top.

SELECT TOP 5: Limits the output to only the top 5 rows after sorting.

---

### 3. Sales Trend by Time of Day
Problem: Analyze how sales vary throughout different times of the day (Morning, Afternoon, Evening). This can inform staffing and marketing strategies.
```sql
SELECT
    Time_of_Day,
    COUNT(*) AS NumberOfSales,
    SUM(CAST(REPLACE(money, 'R', '') AS DECIMAL(10, 2))) AS TotalRevenue
FROM
    coffee_sales
GROUP BY
    Time_of_Day
ORDER BY
    CASE
        WHEN Time_of_Day = 'Morning' THEN 1
        WHEN Time_of_Day = 'Afternoon' THEN 2
        WHEN Time_of_Day = 'Evening' THEN 3
        ELSE 4
    END;
```
### Explanation:
COUNT(*): Calculates the number of sales for each Time_of_Day.

SUM(CAST(REPLACE(money, 'R', '') AS DECIMAL(10, 2))): Calculates the total revenue for each Time_of_Day.

GROUP BY Time_of_Day: Groups the results by Time_of_Day to aggregate sales and revenue for each period.

ORDER BY CASE WHEN Time_of_Day = 'Morning' THEN 1 ... END: Orders the results logically by Time_of_Day (Morning, Afternoon, Evening) rather than alphabetically.

### 4. Sales Trend by Weekday
Problem: Determine which weekdays have the highest or lowest sales. This insight is useful for planning promotions or staffing adjustments.
```sql
SELECT
    Weekday,
    COUNT(*) AS NumberOfSales,
    SUM(CAST(REPLACE(money, 'R', '') AS DECIMAL(10, 2))) AS TotalRevenue
FROM
    coffee_sales
GROUP BY
    Weekday, Weekdaysort
ORDER BY
    Weekdaysort;
```
### Explanation:
COUNT(*): Counts the total sales for each Weekday.

SUM(CAST(REPLACE(money, 'R', '') AS DECIMAL(10, 2))): Calculates the total revenue for each Weekday.

GROUP BY Weekday, Weekdaysort: Groups the data by Weekday and Weekdaysort to ensure correct aggregation.

ORDER BY Weekdaysort: Sorts the results by the numerical representation of the weekday (e.g., Monday=1, Tuesday=2), ensuring the days are ordered correctly.

---

### 5. Average Transaction Value
Problem: Calculate the average amount of money spent per transaction. This metric can help assess customer spending habits.
```sql
SELECT
    AVG(CAST(REPLACE(money, 'R', '') AS DECIMAL(10, 2))) AS AverageTransactionValue
FROM
    coffee_sales;
```
### Explanation:
REPLACE(money, 'R', ''): Removes the 'R' prefix from the money column.

CAST(... AS DECIMAL(10, 2)): Converts the cleaned string to a decimal number.

AVG(...): Calculates the average of these converted monetary values across all transactions.

---

### 6. Monthly Sales Over Time
Problem: Track total sales revenue month by month to identify seasonal trends or long-term growth.
```sql
SELECT
    Month_name,
    Monthsort,
    SUM(CAST(REPLACE(money, 'R', '') AS DECIMAL(10, 2))) AS TotalMonthlyRevenue
FROM
    coffee_sales
GROUP BY
    Month_name, Monthsort
ORDER BY
    Monthsort;
```
### Explanation:
SUM(CAST(REPLACE(money, 'R', '') AS DECIMAL(10, 2))): Calculates the total revenue for each month.

GROUP BY Month_name, Monthsort: Groups the data by Month_name and Monthsort to aggregate sales for each month.

ORDER BY Monthsort: Sorts the results by the numerical representation of the month to ensure chronological order.
